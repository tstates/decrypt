# decrypt - password finder for CRYPT(C)COTELEM 1997

Computer magazines in the mid to late 90s often came with a cover CD. Usually, the CD had freeware, shareware, demos, common DLLs, etc. But some French magazines put (encrypted) premium content on their cover CDs, with the decryption key available via Minitel[1]. 

With Minitel being retired from service in June of 2012 all that premium content was at risk of being lost forever. This tiny tool leverages a couple of weaknesses in the encryption algorithm to find the password (given an encrypted file as parameter).
